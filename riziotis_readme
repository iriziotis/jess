-This version of Jess has some slight modifications
so that it can be incorporated to the catalytic templates
pipeline.

-Modifications:
  1) HETATM entries are now not ignored when searching for a match
  2) If there are atoms with AltLoc specifiers, these are not ignored anymore, but
     the first atom enters the calculation.
  3) REMARK line was modified so that parse the logE and Det fields are easier to parse

Please note that in some cases, Jess performs multiple optimal aligments at a specific
atom set in a given template-target pair. If you want to keep only the best fit out of all,
pipe the output in my script 'refine_jessout.py'.

Compile with something like:

  gcc -c *.c
  gcc -o jess *.o -lm 
  sudo mv jess /usr/local/bin
