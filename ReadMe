It is not for general relase at this time. Those who wish
to use the program should consult me first. [This is not
because I wish to restrict its use, but because a proper
licensing scheme has not been implemented, and it is not
yet in a state where I wish to support wide use]

INTRODUCTION

This is Jess version 0.3(beta). The program is still under
development so I'm only making a Linux binary available at
present. If you require the source for some reason come
to see me...

If you have requests for modification or addition of new
features, please let me know. The source is still very
fluid, so if you want feature X, then tell me!

OPERATING JESS

[At present, Jess is a replacement for TESS, but more 
general templates have not yet been implemented].

jess <template-list> <file-list> <rmsd> <distance> [flags] 

template-list is a list of filenames of TESS templates
file-list is a list of filenames of PDB files to search
rmsd is the RMSD cutoff at which results are reported
distance is the distance cutoff used to guide the search

As a rough estimate the distance cutoff should be 1.5-4 times
the RMSD cutoff. But if you make it very large execution 
time will suffer. The smaller the better!

If [flags] is the single character 'f' then Jess outputs the
PDB file currently being processed on stderr.

Example:

> cd examples
> ../jess templates testfiles 2 3 > output

The output file is a flat file containing PDB fragments 
preceded by a single record of the form

REMARK pdb-code rmsd template-file [some debugging info]

where pdb-code is the PDB code of the hit file, rmsd is 
the rmsd after optimal superposition with the template and
template-file is the file containing the template which 
was hit.

The debugging info currently contains Det=number and
log(E)~number. If Det is not 1.0 then the superposition
is not valid (tell me about it please!). log(E) is a
preliminary statistical measure which should be used
with caution. Anything less than -4 should be a very
good hit and -3 is OK. (E is the expected number of hits
at random).

The PDB fragment which follows the remark is transformed 
into the coordinate frame of the template by optimal
superposition.

Each hit is followed by a blank line.

CAVEATS!

Jess and TESS rmsds are not the same!!!! This is because 
TESS aligns the site using a reference group, and Jess 
performs optimal superposition. In many cases this is 
desirable (see template_02 where there are many false
negatives in TESS, but few in Jess). The Jess rmsd will
*always* be <= the TESS rmsd. So cutoffs may well need
to be adjusted.

BUGS!

Probably many. If you find one, tell me about it please!
